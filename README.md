## Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Intrusion Detection
The project focuses on designing an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle intrusion detection system using various machine learning binary classification techniques. The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) for Intrusion Detection dataset contains encrypted Wi-Fi traffic records collected to classify the traffic as a UAV or not. This binary classification is useful to detect UAVs that could pose a threat to the security and privacy of the public. In this dataset, 3 UAVs are considered, namely - Parrot Bebop 1, DBPower UDI, and DJI Spark. Overall, there are 6 datasets, 2 in each category of the UAV. A bidirectional and unidirectional traffic flow is considered for each of the UAVs. In the bidirectional traffic flow, there are 54 features in total (i.e., 9 statistical features like mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for 2 sources - packet sizes and packet inter-arrival time for 3 directional flows – uplink, downlink, and the total traffic flow). In the unidirectional traffic flow, there are 18 features (i.e., 9 statistical features for 2 sources).

## Baseline Model
Developed a baseline model with the raw dataset. Considered bidirectional and unidirectional 
datasets separately and included all the features. On these datasets, the following machine learning 
classification techniques were applied:-
1) Logistic Regression
2) K-Nearest Neighbors, with k =3 (KNN)
3) Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
4) Decision Tree
5) Bagging
6) Random Forest, with √54 ~ 7 features in bidirectional dataset and √18 ~ 4 features in the 
unidirectional dataset
7) Boosting
8) Support Vector Machine, with radial kernel (SVM)

## Approach 1: Manual Inspection
After visualizing the dataset, eliminated the features based on their contribution to the dataset and the classification output. Initially, the features with low spread of data and many outliers were dropped. Along with these features, features that were present only in bidirectional dataset were also dropped. The bidirectional and unidirectional datasets were combined to form the dataset. This dataset consisted of 6241 datapoints and 11 features. 

## Approach 2: Regularization using Lasso Regression
In this approach the raw dataset was taken and after the uncommon features between bidirectional and unidirectional were eliminated, the datasets were combined. Therefore, the training dataset had 6241 datapoints with 18 features before regularization.

## Approach 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
The Principal Component Analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by forming principal components that are linear combinations of all the features from the dataset. These principal components capture features and the regions where data vary the most. Each principal component is uncorrelated and hence orthogonal to each other. In this way, the dataset is explained efficiently using PCA. After plotting the datasets, the spread of the two classes were easy to interpret. The bidirectional dataset, there is a clear separation between the 0 and 1 class, whereas in unidirectional dataset, the dataset seems to be more correlated. For this approach, the bidirectional and unidirectional datasets were considered separately and PCA was applied on each of them. It was found that the first 4 and first 2 principal components explained 85% variance in the bidirectional and unidirectional datasets, respectively.
